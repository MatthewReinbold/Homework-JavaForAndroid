#Homework-JavaForAndroid
=======================

##Introduction
This are excercises done while working through two books. The first is **Learn Java for Android Development** (Second Edition) by Jeff Friesen. It was published by Apress in 2013. The second is **Learning Android: Develop Mobile Apps Using Java and Eclipse** by Marko Gargenta & Masumi Nakamura. Also a 2nd edition, it was published by O'Reilly in 2014.

Many of the exercises are (most likely) done directly from the given examples and should not be considered standalone bits of functaionlity. Got a resource for learning Android development? I'd love to hear it. 

##Getting Started
Many of the initial java files are compiled (using javac xxxx.java) and then run (java xxxx.class) from the command line.

## Progress Log
- 2014-02-27 - too long; restarting chapt 5 in *Learning Android*; finally getting to a sample application in chapter 6, **Yamba** - but, *zonk*, that's only talking about what you *might* be able to do; feel uncomfortable with using a cloud service made explicitly for the book. Will this be there a year from now? Two? Does this book have an unpublished EOL, after which the sample code will be worthless? end page 101
- 2014-02-05 - *Learning Android*: environment is set up from the ADT documentation, along with a sample program. Skipping to worthwhile bits. Sent error to Codealike that their Eclipse Beta link didn't seem to work. End pg. 63
- 2014-02-04 - *Learning Android*: getting the android dev environment set up; bummed this is Eclipse based, as I won't have time logging with Codeivate and it's Sublime Text integration; installed ADT in a Ubuntu 64-bit VM. Initially had trouble with 'adb' package missing. Turns out ADT has a 32-bit dependency that appeared to be resolved when I followed the instructions [on Vogella.com](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidInstallation/article.html#installation_linux64). Rather than follow the example in the book, got the example that came with the installation, "My First App", to compile and launch in an emulator.

- 2014-02-03 - *Learning Android*: Skipped Bad Chapter 2 Code, Went to Chapter 3's Overview of 'The Stack' (20m), end pg. 43
- 2014-02-02 - Skimmed Chapter 6, *Learn Java for Android*, the deep, deep features (1 hour, end pg. 269)
- 2014-02-01 and before - didn't track in this doc
